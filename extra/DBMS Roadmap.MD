## **Learn SQL Fundamentals**

- **Basic Syntax:** Understand the basic structure of SQL commands and statements.
- **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
  - **`CREATE`**: Create databases, tables, and other database objects.
  - **`ALTER`**: Modify existing database objects.
  - **`DROP`**: Delete databases, tables, or other objects.

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
  - **`SELECT`**: Retrieve data from tables.
  - **`INSERT`**: Add new rows to a table.
  - **`UPDATE`**: Modify existing rows.
  - **`DELETE`**: Remove rows from a table.

## **Learn SQL Query Techniques**

- **Filtering Data:** Use `WHERE` clauses to filter records.
- **Sorting Data:** Apply `ORDER BY` to sort results.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Use functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()` to perform calculations.
- **Grouping Data:** Use `GROUP BY` to group records and perform aggregate calculations.

## **Understand Joins and Relationships**

- **Inner Join:** Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- **Left Join (or Left Outer Join):** Retrieve all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
- **Right Join (or Right Outer Join):** Retrieve all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
- **Full Join (or Full Outer Join):** Retrieve all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.
- **Self Join:** Join a table with itself.

## **Advanced SQL Concepts**

- **Subqueries:** Learn to use nested queries to retrieve data.
- **Indexes:** Understand how to create and use indexes to improve query performance.
- **Views:** Create and manage views to simplify complex queries and improve security.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions:** Write and use stored procedures and functions for reusable SQL code.

## **Explore SQL Optimization and Best Practices**

- **Query Optimization:** Learn techniques for writing efficient queries and optimizing performance.
- **Normalization:** Understand database normalization to design efficient schemas.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Familiarize yourself with SQL database backup and recovery procedures.
